Regression.
==============================

A fairly straightforward regression based data analysis project.
This project focuses on :
    1. Data Pre-Processing and Cleaning
    2. Exploratory Data Analyses
    3. Linear Regression Model Training and Predictions

A lot of the folders are going to be empty or not really useful, simply because I haven't fleshed out anything except the actual data science stuff.
If you have any suggestions or pointers, do let me know.
Also, you're free to use/reuse this as you see fit, just make sure you don't get caught.
